# News Summarizer - Multi-Provider Edition

## Overview

This project fetches the latest news articles from a configurable category and summarizes them using multiple Large Language Model (LLM) providers: **OpenAI** and **Cohere**.  
It also performs sentiment analysis on the summaries and tracks API usage costs.

Key features:
- Multi-provider support with **fallback** (OpenAI → Cohere).
- Synchronous and asynchronous processing of articles.
- Detailed **news summary report** including source, URL, summary, and sentiment.
- **Cost tracking** for each API request.
- Configurable number of articles and categories.

## Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-summarizer.git
   cd news-summarizer
Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate      # Linux / macOS
venv\Scripts\activate         # Windows
Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up API keys in config.py:

OPENAI_API_KEY = "your_openai_api_key"
COHERE_API_KEY = "your_cohere_api_key"
OPENAI_MODEL = "gpt-4o-mini"
COHERE_MODEL = "command-xlarge-nightly"
OPENAI_RPM = 20   # requests per minute
COHERE_RPM = 10
DAILY_BUDGET = 10.0  # USD
Running the Application
Run the main script:

python main.py
You will be prompted to enter:

News category (technology, business, health, general)

Number of articles to process (1–10)

Whether to use async processing (y/n)

Example session:

Enter news category (technology/business/health/general): general
How many articles to process? (1-10): 3
Use async processing? (y/n): y

COST SUMMARY
================================================================================
Total requests: 2
Total cost: $0.0015
Total tokens: 331
  Input: 205
  Output: 126
Average cost per request: $0.000756
================================================================================
Cost Analysis
The project tracks API usage for OpenAI and Cohere:

Total requests – number of LLM API calls made.

Input tokens – number of tokens sent in prompts.

Output tokens – number of tokens generated by the LLM.

Total cost – calculated per-token based on each provider's pricing.

Average cost per request – helpful for budgeting.

Pricing example (per million tokens):

Model	Input ($/M tokens)	Output ($/M tokens)
gpt-4o-mini	0.15	0.60
command-xlarge-nightly	1.50	6.00
Testing
Run unit tests using:

python -m unittest test_summarizer.py -v
All tests are mocked and do not call the real APIs, so you can test locally without spending credits.

Notes
Async processing improves speed when fetching and summarizing multiple articles concurrently.

Fallback mechanism ensures that if OpenAI fails, Cohere is used as a backup.

Adjust the daily budget in config.py to avoid unexpected costs.
